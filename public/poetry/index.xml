      <description>  I am absorbed on the net  Seeing the whole world  Yet chained I remain  And watch the time go     Ignoring family and friends  To live my life virtual  I truly remain unhappy  Trapped in this fake realm     At last my phone goes out  Freeing me of this burden  Bringing light to my soul  To show me the real world   </description>

      <description>  The peace of silence is all but forgotten  Giving time for me to ponder my thoughts  Allowing me to see what is not noticed  Bringing light to what I thought was gone     I now see the truth of my worldâ€™s reality  No longer do I remain so blind to atrocity  Now is my time to take a form action  And show the world the the power of unity     </description>

      <description>  Dungeons of stress chain me  Eating my freedom away  At last I take time to relax  To ease my ghastly pain  And healing my lasting wounds  Now letting me be away of fray  The calm soothes my soul  Making me feel reborn  I feel ready to go out  And face challenges of the world   </description>

      <description>  The city mighty of Austin  Is home to my school  I visit here often  Cause my university is a jewel     Home to the Longhorns of UT  A school that is also an emotion  Working hard to get my degree  But that is not my real notion     To meet people in my 4 years  Giving me jolly tales to tell later  Friends part ways as the future nears  But our memories remain greater   </description>

      <description>  Hum naachate hain uske ishaaron par  Azad hain hum nahi  Issme hain humare khushi  Kyon ki woh ho sabase mahaan  Hum usse mahasoos nahi kar paate  Phir bhee woh hai yahin  Surarakshit hain hum tabhee  Jab tak hain uske saath   </description>

      <description>  People wait for their chance  To go out and have a dance  Yet he still prowls in wait  Waiting of your date  Nothing is more morbid  Than COVID of the horrid  He journeys to the lung  And there remains clung  May all proceed with caution  Or fight him as an option   </description>
