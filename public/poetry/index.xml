      <description>  The city mighty of Austin  Is home to my school  I visit here often  Cause my university is a jewel     Home to the Longhorns of UT  A school that is also an emotion  Working hard to get my degree  But that is not my real notion     To meet people in my 4 years  Giving me jolly tales to tell later  Friends part ways as the future nears  But our memories remain greater   </description>

      <description>  People wait for their chance  To go out and have a dance  Yet he still prowls in wait  Waiting of your date  Nothing is more morbid  Than COVID of the horrid  He journeys to the lung  And there remains clung  May all proceed with caution  Or fight him as an option   </description>
