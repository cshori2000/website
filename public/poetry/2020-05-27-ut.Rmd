##The city mighty of Austin
##Is home to my school
##I visit here often
##Cause my university is a jewel

##Eating meals at the food trucks
##From Arloâ€™s to Home Slice
##Always worth your bucks
##And never fail to entice

##Home to the Longhorns of UT
##A school that is also an emotion
##Working hard to get my degree
##But that is not my real notion

##To meet people in my 4 years
##Giving me jolly tales to tell later
#Friends part ways as future nears
#But our memories remain greater

##To say the end has come
##Means to be telling lies
##I will not forget all that I have done
##And am now ready to feel the skies
