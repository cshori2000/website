##The peace of silence is all but forgotten
##Giving time for me to ponder my thoughts 
##Allowing me to see what is not noticed
##Bringing light to what I thought was gone

##I now see the truth of my worldâ€™s reality
##No longer do I remain so blind to atrocity
##Now is my time to take a form action
##And show the world the the power of unity
