##My Thoughts

Well, I have to say this year is one to remember. Who ever thought COVID-19 would turn our lives upside down in a matter of weeks. It is still feels unreal to say that I was walking outside and hanging out with my friends, but now I am cooped up inside my house living with trepidation of not knowing what will happen next. The most difficult part to fathom is that I will not be able to see my friends for almost 6 months. Fortunately, due to our technological innovations, I am able to stay in touch with my friends virtually. However, I still feel these are not the same as in person interactions. Hopefully, this all settles down soon considering vaccine is in the works.
