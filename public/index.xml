      <description>  I am absorbed on the net  Seeing the whole world  Yet chained I remain  And watch the time go     I truly remain unhappy  Trapped in this fake realm  Ignoring family and friends  To live my life virtual     At last my phone goes out  Freeing me of this burden  Bringing light to my soul  To show me the real world   </description>

      <description>  The peace of silence is all but forgotten  Giving time for me to ponder my thoughts  Allowing me to see what is not noticed  Bringing light to what I thought was gone     I now see the truth of my world’s reality  No longer do I remain so blind to atrocity  Now is my time to take a form action  And show the world the the power of unity     </description>

      <description>  Dungeons of stress chain me  Eating my freedom away  At last I take time to relax  To ease my ghastly pain  And healing my lasting wounds  Now letting me be away of fray  The calm soothes my soul  Making me feel reborn  I feel ready to go out  And face challenges of the world   </description>

      <description>  The city mighty of Austin  Is home to my school  I visit here often  Cause my university is a jewel     Home to the Longhorns of UT  A school that is also an emotion  Working hard to get my degree  But that is not my real notion     To meet people in my 4 years  Giving me jolly tales to tell later  Friends part ways as the future nears  But our memories remain greater   </description>

      <description>My Thoughts Well, I have to say this year is one to remember. Who ever thought COVID-19 would turn our lives upside down in a matter of weeks. It is still feels unreal to say that I was walking outside and hanging out with my friends, but now I am cooped up inside my house living with trepidation of not knowing what will happen next. The most difficult part to fathom is that I will not be able to see my friends for almost 6 months.</description>

      <description>  People wait for their chance  To go out and have a dance  Yet he still prowls in wait  Waiting of your date  Nothing is more morbid  Than COVID of the horrid  He journeys to the lung  And there remains clung  May all proceed with caution  Or fight him as an option   </description>

      <description>Python Python and R are both fascinating on their own. However when put together, these two softwares can become a powerful tool that can solve complex issues. Below we have an example of how we have used Python to determine all possible k-mers of a particular sequence, which is particularly very useful in the field of bioinformatics.
##Python Chunk my_seq = &amp;quot;ATCATCATG&amp;quot; def k_mercount(sequence): subs = [sequence[x:x+3] for x in range(len(sequence)) if len(sequence[x:x+3]) &amp;gt; 2] kmers = {} for i in subs: if i in kmers: kmers[i] += 1 else: kmers[i] = 1 print(kmers) k_mercount(my_seq) ## {&amp;#39;ATG&amp;#39;: 1, &amp;#39;CAT&amp;#39;: 2, &amp;#39;ATC&amp;#39;: 2, &amp;#39;TCA&amp;#39;: 2}  R Now we will demonstrate the use of R on a dataset.</description>

Introduction: The first data set chosen for this project is the lung dataset. The lung dataset contains data about survival among patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. This dataset contains 10 variables, and these variables are inst, time, status, age, sex, ph.ecog, ph.karno, pat.karno, meal.cal, and wt.loss. The inst variable represents the institution code, the time variable represents the survival time in days, the status variable represents the censoring status, the age variable represents the age in years, meal.</description>
