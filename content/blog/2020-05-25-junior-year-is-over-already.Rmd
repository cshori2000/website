##My Thoughts

Well, I have to say this year is one to remember. Who ever thought COVID-19 would turn our lives upside down in a matter of weeks. It is still feels unreal to say that I was walking outside and hanging out with my friends, but now I am cooped up inside my house living with trepidation of not knowing what will happen next. The most difficult part to fathom is that I will not be able to see my friends for almost 6 months. Fortunately, due to our technological innovations, I am able to stay in touch with my friends virtually. However, I still feel these are not the same as in person interactions. Hopefully, this all settles down soon considering vaccine is in the works.

However, I do look forward to time to self-reflect and pursue some of my hobbies that I have not had time to do in the past year due to my busy schedule. I especially am excited about being more consistent with writing poetry as I was on and off this past year due to things picking up with my degree, and think this will help me better express myself in my writing. Sometimes I feel that it is very difficult to voice my opinion when I am invested in the sciences as those subjects do not teach such skills, but I hope to change that this summer. Ideally, I hope I am able to come out of this pandemic with some new skills as well, while polishing some of my old ones.
