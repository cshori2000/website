##When I walk outside
##I see a pale dude with creepy eyes
##He looks like a smoker
##But he is really a crazy joker
##I walk towards him thinking him to be a friends
##And he pulls a knife out with sharp ends
##I begin to run with no place to hide
##Yet more mad men continue to surprise
##I am surrounded with death awaiting 
##My life to be lost to these freaks
##I begin to scream, and realize this is a dream
##I soon awake from my slumber, but soon see a man awaiting
##The same man from my dream is back to end my screams
##Oh clown what do you want from me
##Run for those of you who can
##Run to save your life from these freaks
