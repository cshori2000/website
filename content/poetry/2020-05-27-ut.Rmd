#The city mighty of Austin
#Is home to my school
#I visit here often
#Cause my university is a jewel

#Home to the Longhorns of UT
#A school that is also an emotion
#Working hard to get my degree
#But that is not my real notion

#To meet people in my 4 years
#Giving me jolly tales to tell later
#Friends part ways as the future nears
#But our memories remain greater
